Violations: Austin ISD reported around 20 instances where Waymo vehicles illegally drove past buses with extended stop arms and flashing red lights.  sensor confusion (occlusion, angle), misinterpreting the flashing lights/stop arm as irrelevant  on a divided road), AI misclassification (treating bus as regular truck), or mapping errors, with challenges including complex visual data, perspective issues, and the need for absolute certainty. A Waymo programmer could implement a sensor fusion rule using dedicated bus-stop sign hardware/visual recognition combined with V2X communication for redundancy, plus a hard-coded emergency stop logic triggered by any bus-like object with flashing lights/extended arm, ensuring stopping is the default action, as Waymo recently recalled software for such failures.
